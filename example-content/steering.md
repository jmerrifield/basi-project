These elements are involved in Steering a snowboard around an arc:

* **Pressure Control**
  1. **Flexion and extension** - Controlling the pressure of the snowboard egains√Æ 
the snow. 
  2. **Fore and aft** - Controlling the Weight distribution between the nose and 
tail of the board. 
* **Edge control** - Controlling the tilting of the board onto its edge relative to the 
Snow. It is also the amount of tortional flex used in pedalling for different 
amounts of grip along the edge. 
* **Control of leg rotation** - controlling the amount the board is steered 
across the direction of travel. 

These can be referred to as the steering elements of snowboarding. 

The steering elements can be blended to produce a variety of different 
snowboarding turns. Every technique or type of turn can be analysed and 
described as a combination ot these steering elements. 

It is important to recognize that the steering elements do not operate in 
isolation from one another. Every snowboarding turn - from the most 
elementary to the most advanced - involves all these elements. What 
distinguishes different types of tum is the amount of each element, and the 
order in which they are appiied. 

For example, basic turns are otten taught by emphasizing the shift of weight 
forwards, stretching the legs and flattening the front foot at the initiation ofthe 
turn. The board is encouraged to change onto its new edge at whatever point 
feels natural to the rider. Carved turns, however, are taught with the emphasis 
on edge control, encouraging the board to change onto its new edge early in 
the turn. Fore and aft pressure control subtle and weignt moves more to the 
tail of the board at the end of the turn. 

ln both examples, all the steering elements are involved. What distinguishes 
the two types of turn is the precise blend, sequence and timing with which the elements are applied.
